## Practical Motivation
Dire consequences of false and dis-information today, especially due to the increase in recent anti-asian hate crimes from Covid-19 due to spread of fake news

## Problem Formulation & Statement
How can we effectively differentiate between real and fake news using features of the article?

## Data Preparation
#### 1. Data Cleaning 
- Junk Values in Excel 
- Dropping NaN values, relabelling of columns 
- Changing improper data types 
#### 2. Removal of irrelevant values 
- Symbols, Stopwords from title and text 
#### 3. Created new columns 
- Title,text and stopword count
- Lemmatisation and Tokenisation 
- Sentiment Generation using polarity scores 
- Emotion Generation 
#### 4. Final clean-up and saving of cleaned dataset

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
#### 1. Initial Assumptions and data-driven insights from dataset and research 
#### 2. Word Count Analysis of title and text
#### 3. Corpus Analysis 
- Unigram and Bigram analysis 
#### 4. Stopword Count Analysis
#### 5. Sentiment Analysis
#### 6. Emotion Analysis
#### 7. Correlation



##  Models used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine Classifier
5. Ensemble

## Outcome
#### -
